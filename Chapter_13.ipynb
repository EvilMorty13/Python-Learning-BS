        "# Clean and Modular Code\n",
        "\n",
        "Writing clean and modular code helps make Python projects more maintainable, scalable, and readable. Below are some key guidelines for achieving this:\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. **Use Meaningful Names**\n",
        "- Choose **descriptive names** for variables, functions, classes, and modules.\n",
        "  - Example: Use `calculate_total_price()` instead of `calc()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. **Keep Functions Small and Focused**\n",
        "- A function should perform **one task** and do it well. Break down large functions into smaller, reusable ones.\n",
        "  - Example: A function for user authentication should not handle file I/O.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. **Limit Function Parameters**\n",
        "- Limit the number of parameters a function takes. When there are too many, consider grouping them into a dictionary or class.\n",
        "  - Example: Prefer `def create_user(data):` over `def create_user(name, age, address, email):`.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. **Avoid Global Variables**\n",
        "- Avoid using global variables. Use parameters and return values to pass data between functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 5. **Use Comments Wisely**\n",
        "- Write **clear and concise comments** that explain why (not how) something is done.\n",
        "  - Example: `# Initialize with empty data` instead of `# Set data to an empty list`.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 6. **Follow DRY Principle (Don’t Repeat Yourself)**\n",
        "- Avoid duplicate code. If you find yourself copying code, create a function or class to reuse it.\n",
        "  - Example: Refactor repeated logic into functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 7. **Write Modular Code**\n",
        "- Break your code into **smaller modules** and files based on functionality.\n",
        "  - Example: Separate database logic, API routes, and utility functions into different files.\n",
        "\n"

        "## 1. Variable Names\n",
        "- Use **lowercase letters**, with words separated by underscores (snake_case).\n",
        "  - Example: `my_variable`, `count_total`, `file_name`\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Function Names\n",
        "- Function names should be **lowercase**, with words separated by underscores.\n",
        "  - Example: `calculate_total()`, `get_user_info()`\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. Class Names\n",
        "- Use **CamelCase** (PascalCase), where each word starts with an uppercase letter and there are no underscores.\n",
        "  - Example: `UserProfile`, `DataProcessor`\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. Constants\n",
        "- Use **uppercase letters**, with words separated by underscores.\n",
        "  - Example: `MAX_CONNECTIONS`, `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`\n",
        "\n",
        "## 5. Modules and Packages\n",
        "- Use **short, lowercase names**. Underscores can be used to improve readability.\n",
        "  - Example: `my_module.py`, `data_processing.py`\n",
        "\n",
        "## 6. Private Variables and Methods\n",
        "- To indicate a variable or method is private, use a **single leading underscore**.\n",
        "  - Example: `_internal_variable`, `_private_method()`\n",
        "\n",
        "## 7. Special Variables\n",
        "- Use **double leading and trailing underscores** (known as \"dunder\" methods) for system-defined names.\n",
        "  - Example: `__init__()`, `__str__()`, `__name__`\n",
        "\n",
        "## 8. Global Variables\n",
        "- Use **all uppercase letters**, with words separated by underscores for global constants.\n",
        "  - Example: `GLOBAL_CONFIG`\n",
        "\n",
        "## 9. Method Names in Classes\n",
        "- Method names should follow the same convention as functions: **lowercase with underscores**.\n",
        "  - Example: `def get_data(self):`, `def fetch_results(self):`\n",
        "\n",
        "## 10. Avoid Reserved Words\n",
        "- Avoid using Python reserved keywords like `class`, `def`, `try`, `finally` as variable or function names.\n"

        "**Description:**  \n",
        "Integration testing ensures that different parts of the application work together as expected. It tests how modules, services, or APIs interact with each other, catching issues that arise when components are integrated.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**  \n",
        "Suppose you have two modules: one for user login and another for sending email notifications. An integration test would ensure that after a user successfully logs in, the system sends the appropriate email. This verifies the interaction between the two modules.\n",

        "In an e-commerce application, a functional test might check whether a user can successfully add items to the shopping cart, proceed to checkout, and complete the payment. This ensures the system works according to the specified business logic and requirements."
