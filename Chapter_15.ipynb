        "In Mojo, the concepts of **Inout**, **Borrowed**, and **Owned** are essential for managing memory and data ownership effectively. These concepts help ensure safe memory access and performance optimization.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Inout\n",
        "- **Definition**: Inout parameters allow a function to modify the value of an argument passed to it. The function can both read and write to the variable without transferring ownership.\n",
        "- **Usage**: Useful for functions that need to modify multiple values or return multiple results.\n",
        "- **Example**:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  func updateValue(inout x: int) {\n",
        "      x += 10  # Modify the original value\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Borrowed\n",
        "- **Definition**: Borrowed references allow temporary access to a value without taking ownership. The borrowing can be mutable or immutable.\n",
        "- **Usage**: Useful for functions that need read-only or temporary write access to data without transferring ownership, ensuring that the original data remains intact after the function call.\n",
        "- **Example**:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  func printValue(borrowed x: int) {\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Owned\n",
        "- **Definition**: Owned variables represent values that have full ownership. When an owned value is passed to a function, ownership is transferred to that function, and the original variable can no longer be used.\n",
        "- **Usage**: Useful for managing resources that should have clear ownership and lifecycle management, preventing memory leaks and dangling references.\n",
        "- **Example**:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  func takeOwnership(owned x: string) {\n",
